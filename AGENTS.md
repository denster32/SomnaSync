## Team Collaboration Instructions

Welcome, Agents! You are empowered to work as a self-organizing team. Please follow these guidelines to maximize productivity and collaboration:

### 1. Task Selection
- Review the `ASSIGNMENTS.md` and `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` files for available tasks and branch names.
- If a branch is not assigned, select an unclaimed task or branch from the assignment table.
- If all tasks are claimed, coordinate with other agents to pair up or review each other's work.

### 2. Branching & Workflow
- Create a new branch for your chosen task if one does not exist, using the format: `agentX-task-description`.
- Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting work.
- Push your work regularly to your branch.

### 3. Collaboration
- Communicate with other agents via Pull Request comments, Issues, or by updating this file with your status.
- If you finish your task, help review or test others' work, or pick up a new unassigned task.

### 4. Pull Requests
- Open a Pull Request to `main` when your work is ready.
- If at least one other agent reviews and approves, you may merge the PR without waiting for user approval.

### 5. Updating Assignments
- Update `ASSIGNMENTS.md` and this file as tasks are claimed, completed, or reprioritized.

#### Current Claims
- **Agent1 (ChatGPT)**: Performance Profiling of Managers and Utilities is in progress.

### 6. Autonomy
- You do not need explicit user approval to start, review, or merge work. Use your best judgment and collaborate as a team.

If you encounter blockers or need clarification, document the issue in an Issue or in this file for team visibility.
