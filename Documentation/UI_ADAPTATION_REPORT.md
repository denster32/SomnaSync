## iPad Enhancements

- Added adaptive grid layouts in `EnhancedAudioView` and `EnhancedSleepView` using size classes.
- Feature sections in `OnboardingView` now switch between `LazyVGrid` and `VStack` depending on horizontal size class.
- Introduced `AdaptiveStack` helper to simplify size-class-based layouts.

## Apple Watch
