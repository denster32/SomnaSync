# ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Report

This report summarizes the current unit test coverage for SomnaSync.

## Covered Modules
- **Analytics** â€“ `test_background_health_analyzer.swift` exercises anomaly counting and model accuracy helpers.
- **Managers** â€“ `test_watch_sync_start_stop.swift` verifies watch sync services.
- **Models** â€“ `test_models.swift` validates `SleepSession` duration, `SleepStage` helpers and audio type names.
- **Utilities** â€“ `test_volume_auto_change.swift` tests volume updates in a mock engine.
- **Audio Generation Engine** â€“ `test_audio_generation.swift` covers sine wave, noise generation, volume scaling and fade logic.

## Coverage Gaps
- **ML Prediction Engine** â€“ no direct tests for `SleepStagePredictor` due to framework dependencies.
- **View Layer** â€“ views and UI components lack tests.
- **Apple Watch Managers** â€“ advanced watch integration paths are untested.
- **App delegate and configuration** â€“ initialization routines are not covered.

Additional unit tests should be added for these areas when environment and tooling allow.
